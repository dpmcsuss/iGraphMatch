Description: iGraphMatch is a R package for graph matching. The package
  works for both igraph objects and matrix objects. You provide the adjacency
  matrices of two graphs and some other information you might know, choose the
  graph matching method, and it returns the graph matching results. iGraphMatch
  also provides a bunch of useful functions you might need related to graph
  matching.
