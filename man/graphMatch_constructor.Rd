\title{Graph matching results class}
\usage{
graphMatch(corr, nnodes, call = NULL, detail = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{corr}{data.frame indicating the correspondence between two graphs}

\item{nnodes}{dimensions of the original two graphs}

\item{call}{The call to the graph matching function}

\item{detail}{List with other more detailed information}
}
\value{
graphMatch object
}
\description{
An 'S4' class for the results of a graph matching function
}
\details{
graphMatch objects are returned by any of the graph matching methods
  implemented in the iGraphMatch package. These objects are primarily to
  represent the found correspondence between the two vertex sets. This is
  represented by a data.frame with two columns indicating the aligned
  vertex-pairs across the two graphs.
