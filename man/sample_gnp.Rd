\title{Sample correlated G(n,p) random graphs}
\usage{
sample_correlated_gnp_pair(n, corr, p, ncore = n, permutation = 1:n, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer. Number of total vertices for the sampled graphs.}

\item{corr}{A number. The target Pearson correlation between the adjacency matrices
of the generated graphs. It must be in  [0,1] interval.}

\item{p}{A number. Edge probability between two vertices. It must be in open
[0,1] interval.}

\item{ncore}{An integer. Number of core vertices.}

\item{permutation}{A numeric vector to permute second graph.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{sample_gnp}.}
}
\value{
\code{sample_correlated_gnp_pair} returns a list of two 'igraph' object, named
\code{graph1} and \code{graph2}, whose adjacency matrix entries
are correlated with \code{corr}. If sample two graphs with junk vertices, the first
\code{ncore} vertices are core vertices and the rest are junk vertices.
}
\description{
Sample a pair of correlated G(n,p) random graphs with correlation between
two graphs being \code{corr} and edge probability being \code{p}.
