sample_correlated_ieg_pair(
  n,
  p_mat,
  c_mat,
  ncore = n,
  directed = FALSE,
  loops = FALSE,
  permutation = 1:n
)

}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer. Number of total vertices for the sampled graphs.}

\item{p_mat}{An \code{n-by-n} matrix. Edge probability matrix, each entry
should be in the open (0,1) interval.}

\item{c_mat}{An \code{n-by-n} matrix. The target Pearson correlation matrix,
each entry should be in the open (0,1) interval.}

\item{ncore}{An integer. Number of core vertices.}

\item{directed}{Logical scalar, whether to generate directed graphs.}

\item{loops}{Logical scalar, whether self-loops are allowed in the graph.}

\item{permutation}{A numeric vector,permute second graph.}

\item{X}{A matrix. Dot products matrix, each entry must be in open (0,1)
interval.}

\item{corr}{A number. The target Pearson correlation between the adjacency
matrices of the generated graphs. It must be in open (0,1) interval.}

\value{
\code{sample_correlated_ieg_pair} returns two igraph objects named
  \code{graph1} and \code{graph2}. If sample two graphs with junk vertices,
  the first \code{ncore} vertices are core vertices and the rest are junk
  vertices.

\code{sample_correlated_rdpg_pair} returns two igraph objects named
\code{graph1} and \code{graph2} that are sampled from random dot product
graphs model. If sample two graphs with junk vertices, the first
\code{ncore} vertices are core vertices and the rest are junk vertices.

\description{
Sample a pair of graphs with specified edge probability and
  correlation between each pair of vertices.
