\title{Center adjacency matrix}
\usage{
center_graph(A, scheme)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A matrix or an igraph object. Adjacency matrix.}

\item{scheme}{A number or a character. Type of matrix to return. If approximatedly center
the adjacency matrix using Universal Singular Value Thresholding, specify \code{scheme} with
the number of singular values used to estimate the expectation of adjacency matrix. Suitable
choice of scheme can be obtained with rank of order logn, where n is the dimension of A, expecially
in the setting of latent space graph models.}
}
\value{
\code{center_graph} returns a centered adjacency matrix. 'Naive' scheme returns the
original adjacency matrix. 'Center' scheme returns a centered adjacency matrix with entries
equal to -1 or 1 where 1 corresponds to an edge. Scheme specified by a number returns a centered
adjacency matrix, which is calcalated by: A - \hat{Q}, where \hat{Q} is an approximate
estimation of the expectation of A by using Universal Singular Value Thresholding.
}
\description{
Center the adjacency matrix, including center the adjacency matrix to entries
equal to -1 or 1, center the adjacency matrix by using Universal Singular Value Thresholding.
