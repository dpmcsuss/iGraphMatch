\title{Chemical synapses and electrical synapses networks of roundworm}
\format{
An object of class \code{list} of length 2.
}
\usage{
data(C.Elegans)
}
\description{
C.Elegans networks consist of the chemical synapses network and the
electrical synapses network of the roundworm, where each of 279 nodes
represents a neuron and each edge represents the intensity of synapses
connections between two neurons.
}
\details{
Two networks are weighted and directed graphs with self-loops.
There are 2194 and 1031 edges in two graphs respectively and the empirical
Pearson's correlation between two graphs is 0.17.
Two networks are stored in a list in the form of igraph objects, where
the first network in the list is the chemical synapses network and the
other one is the electrical synapses network.
