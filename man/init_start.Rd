\title{Initialization of the start matrix}
\usage{
init_start(start, nns, ns = 0, soft_seeds = NULL, A = NULL, B = NULL,
  seeds = NULL, g = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{A matrix or a character. Any \code{nns-by-nns} doubly stochastic matrix or start
method like "bari", "convex" or "rds" to initialize the start matrix.}

\item{nns}{An integer. Number of non-seeds.}

\item{ns}{An integer. Number of seeds.}

\item{soft_seeds}{A vector, a matrix or a data frame. If there is no error in the soft seeds,
input can be a vector of soft seed indices in \eqn{G_1}. Or if there is error in soft seeds,
input should be in the form of a matrix or a data frame, with the first column being the
indices of \eqn{G_1} and the second column being the corresponding indices of \eqn{G_2}.
Note that if there are seeds in graphs, seeds should be put before non-seeds.}

\item{A}{A matrix or an igraph object. Adjacency matrix of \eqn{G_1}. Needed only when start is
convex.}

\item{B}{A matrix or an igraph object. Adjacency matrix of \eqn{G_2}. Needed only when start is
convex.}

\item{seeds}{A logical vector. \code{TRUE} indicates the corresponding vertex is a seed. Needed
only when start is convex.}

\item{g}{A number. Specified in the range of [0,1] to set weights to random permutaion matrix and
barycenter matrix.}
}
\value{
\code{init_start} returns a \code{nns-by-nns} doubly stochastic matrix as the start
matrix in the graph matching iteration. If conduct a soft seeding graph matching, returns a
\code{nns-by-nns} doubly stochastic matrix with 1's corresponding to the soft seeds and values
at the other places are derived by different start method.
}
\description{
Initialize the start matrix for graph matching iteration.

\examples{
ss <- matrix(c(5,4,4,3), nrow = 2)
# initialize start matrix without soft seeds
init_start(start = "bari", nns = 5)
init_start(start = "rds", nns = 3)
init_start(start = "rds_perm_bari", nns = 5)

# initialize start matrix with soft seeds
init_start(start = "bari", nns = 5, ns = 3, soft_seeds = c(5,7,8))
init_start(start = "rds", nns = 5, soft_seeds = ss)
init_start(start = "rds_perm_bari", nns = 5, soft_seeds = ss)

# initialize start matrix for convex graph matching
cgnp_pair <- sample_correlated_gnp_pair(n = 10, corr =  0.3, p =  0.5)
g1 <- cgnp_pair$graph1
g2 <- cgnp_pair$graph2
seeds <- 1:10 <= 2
init_start(start = "convex", nns = 8, A = g1, B = g2, seeds = seeds)

# FW graph matching with incorrect seeds to start at convex start
init_start(start = "convex", nns = 8, ns = 2, soft_seeds = ss, A = g1, B = g2, seeds = seeds)
