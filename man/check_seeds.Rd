\title{Standardize seeds input data type}
\usage{
check_seeds(seeds, nv = 0, logical = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seeds}{A vector of integers or logicals, a matrix or a data frame. If there is no error in seeds input can be
a vector of seed indices in \eqn{G_1}. Or if there exists error in seeds, input in the form of a
matrix or a data frame, with the first column being the indices of \eqn{G_1} and the second
column being the corresponding indices of \eqn{G_2}.}

\item{nv}{An integer. Number of total vertices.}

\item{logical}{An logical. TRUE indicates returns seeds in a vector of logicals where TRUE
indicates the corresponding vertex is a seed. FALSE indicates returns a data frame.}
}
\value{
returns a data frame with the first column being the corresponding indices of
\eqn{G_1} and the second column being the corresponding indices of \eqn{G_2} or a vector of
logicals where TRUE indicates the corresponding vertex is a seed.
}
\description{
Convert the input seeds data into data frame type with the first column being the
indices of \eqn{G_1} and the second column being the corresponding indices of \eqn{G_2}
}
\examples{
#input is a vector of logicals
seeds <- 1:10 <= 3
check_seeds(seeds)

#input is a vector of integers
check_seeds(c(1,4,2,7,3))

#input is a matrix
check_seeds(matrix(1:4,2))

#input is a data frame
check_seeds(as.data.frame(matrix(1:4,2)))
