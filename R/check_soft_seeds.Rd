\title{Convert soft seeds data type}
\usage{
check_soft_seeds(soft_seeds)
}
\arguments{
\item{soft_seeds}{A vector, a matrix or a data frame. If there is no error in soft
seeds, input can be a vector of soft seed indices in \eqn{G_1}. Or if there is error in soft
seeds, input in the form of a matrix or a data frame, with the first column being the
indices of \eqn{G_1} and the second column being the corresponding indices of \eqn{G_2}. Note
that if there are seeds in graphs, seeds should be put before non-seeds.}
}
\value{
returns a data frame with the first column being the indices of \eqn{G_1} and the
second column being the corresponding indices of \eqn{G_2}
}
\description{
convert the soft seeds data into data frame type with the first column being the
indices of \eqn{G_1} and the second column being the corresponding indices of \eqn{G_2}
}
\examples{
##input is a vector
check_soft_seeds(c(1,4,2,7,3))

##input is a matrix
check_soft_seeds(matrix(1:4),2)

##input is a data frame
check_soft_seeds(as.data.frame(matrix(1:4),2))
