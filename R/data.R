#' Chemical synapses and electrical synapses networks of roundworm
#'
#' C.Elegans networks consist of the chemical synapses network and the
#' electrical synapses network of the roundworm, where each of 279 nodes
#' represents a neuron and each edge represents the intensity of synapses
#' connections between two neurons.
#'
#' Two networks are weighted and directed graphs with self-loops.
#' There are 2194 and 1031 edges in two graphs respectively and the empirical
#' Pearson's correlation between two graphs is 0.17.
#' Two networks are stored in a list in the form of igraph objects, where
#' the first network in the list is the chemical synapses network and the
#' other one is the electrical synapses network.

#' Email communication networks of Enron Corporation
#'
#' The Enron network data consists of email messages between 184 employees
#' of the Enron Corporation where each graph represents one week of emails
#' and each edge indicates whether there is email sent from one employee to
#' the other.
#'
#' Two networks are unweighted and directed with self-loops.
#' There are 488 and 482 edges in two networks respectively and the empirical
#' Pearson's correlation between two graphs is 0.85.
#' Two email communication networks for two different weeks are stored in a
#' list in the form of igraph objects.

#' Britain Transportation Network
#'
#' The Britain Transportation Network reflects the transportation connections in
#' the UK, with five layers representing ferry, rail, metro, coach, and bus.
#'
#' The data consists of a smaller template graph with 53 nodes and 56 connections
#' across five layers, a larger world graph with candidates of the template graph
#' with 2075 nodes and 8368 connections, and a list of candidate matches for each
#' template node, where the true correspondence is guaranteed to be among the candidates.
#'
#' The template graph was constructed based on a random walk starting from a randomly
#' chosen hub node, a node that has connections in all the layers.
#' All edges in the template are common edges shared by two graphs, where 40\%, 24.1\%,
#' 37.5\%, 31.7\% and 25.6\% of edges in the world graph are in template for each layer.
#' All graphs are unweighted, directed, and do not have self-loops.
#'
#' @format A list of length 3, corresponding to the template graph, world graph, and
#' candidate data frame with first column indicating template node ID's and second column
#' indicating world node ID's.
#' The template graph and world graph are stored as lists of five adjacency matrices,
#' representing ferry, rail, metro, coach, and bus transportation connections respectively.

#' @seealso The original Britain Transportation Network data is found here
#' math.bu.edu/people/sussman/data/Transportation.rda.
#' The template graph and world graph in the `Transportation` data are
#' induced subgraphs of the original graphs , keeping only the candidate nodes.
