#' Chemical synapses and electrical synapses networks of roundworm
#'
#' C.Elegans networks consist of the chemical synapses network and the
#' electrical synapses network of the roundworm, where each of 279 nodes
#' represents a neuron and each edge represents the intensity of synapses
#' connections between two neurons.
#' Two networks are weighted and directed graphs with self-loops.
#' There are 2194 and 1031 edges in two graphs respectively and the empirical
#' Pearson's correlation between two graphs is 0.17.
#' Two networks are stored in a list in the form of igraph objects, where
#' the first network in the list is the chemical synapses network and the
#' other one is the electrical synapses network.

#' Email communication networks of Enron Corporation
#'
#' The Enron network data consists of email messages between 184 employees
#' of the Enron Corporation where each graph represents one week of emails
#' and each edge indicates whether there is email sent from one employee to
#' the other.
#' Two networks are unweighted and directed with self-loops.
#' There are 488 and 482 edges in two networks respectively and the empirical
#' Pearson's correlation between two graphs is 0.85.
#' Two email communication networks for two different weeks are stored in a
#' list in the form of igraph objects.
